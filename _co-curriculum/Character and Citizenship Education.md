### Goals

Values are taught and caught. We create a caring community in a positive environment where values can be explicitly taught, and the school community role models our **ENRICH** school values. Not only is it important for our students to think well and do well, they need to do ‘good’ as well. They should grow up with the mindset of service as a member of their community and our nation, having a strong sense of belonging towards Singapore and the desire to serve, improve and defend Singapore. It is as such that our school’s vision is **‘ Stamfordian community of learners, contributing to our future’**. 

At Stamford,we also build a strong teacher-student relationship in order to understand  every child and cater to his or her needs. Through building positive relationships with parents, community partners and other stakeholders, we optimise this support, because **_‘Every Stamfordian Matters’_**.

### Objectives

We are guided by the goals of CCE delineated by MOE

* Good character
* Resilience and social-emotional well-being
* Active citizenship
* Future readiness

Our school’s ENRICH values are well-aligned to these goals.

### Programmes

The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum aims to impart to our pupils social emotional skills undergirded by values, and to develop them to become responsible citizens of Singapore and of the world. The curriculum is delivered through three main avenues: CCE (FTGP), CCE (MTL) and school-based programmes - customised to our students’ profiles and needs. Both CCE(FTGP) and CCE(MTL) lessons explicitly teach pupils values and social emotional competencies. School-based approaches include **‘Our Stamford Ways’, National Education Commemorative Days Activities** and **Values in Action projects**.

##### CCE(FTGP)

CCE(FTGP) is conducted at all levels once a week. At Stamford Primary, form teachers work together to have “**More about You (MY) Time**” during FTGP. This is where they have one-on-one conversations with their class pupils throughout the year, which enhances the teacher-student relationship. Interaction activities during lessons also foster social skills and encourage peer support and bonding among pupils. Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Values in Action planning and Cyber Wellness lessons are also embedded within the CCE(FTGP) curriculum. 

##### CMT Support

Working closely with a student’s class teachers is the school's Case Management Team who support students identified with special needs. This team comprises of teachers, key personnel and specially trained personnel such as Allied Educators in Learning and Behavioural support and School Counsellors to support these pupils. The team works closely with the school leaders, MOE, parents and external agencies to ensure that the best support is given to our students.

##### Growing Years Series

At Primary 5 and 6, specially trained teachers guide our pupils through the “Curious Minds” package, as part of the Growing Years Series, to learn how to manage the various changes and challenges they face at the onset of puberty. This package from MOE is designed to underscore the importance of character development and health. Topics include the changes involved in puberty, building healthy relationships and the importance of family, attitudes and values towards physical intimacy. More details about MOE’s sexuality education can be found [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/programmes/sexuality-education/scope-and-teaching-approach).

**CCE (MTL) Lessons** <br>
CCE (MTL) lessons are conducted in Mother Tongue at the Primary level. “Family Time” is an important component of CCE lessons, encouraging families to extend the lessons learnt in school to activities at home and reinforcing values to their children. The four core skills pupils learn through CCE lessons are perspective taking, moral reasoning, responsible decision-making and reflection.

**National Education Commemorative Days** <br>
National Education is infused in the school's curriculum and programmes through the commemoration of the four core events: Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day. Through these events, our pupils gain appreciation of our multi-racial and multi-religious society as well as our international friends, how we can defend Singapore to preserve the peace and security we enjoy and in essence, to strengthen our Singapore spirit.

**National Day 2021** <br>
Stamford Primary School commemorated Singapore’s 56th National Day on 6 August with our version of ‘Our HDB homes’ activity.

In 1960, there was a housing crisis in Singapore. Many people were living in unhygienic slums and crowded squatter settlements. Only 9% of Singaporeans lived in government flats, while others yearned for a place to call home.

The Housing & Development Board was thus set up on 1 February 1960, tasked to solve Singapore’s housing crisis.

**Our Spirit Of Resilience** <br>
The students learnt that through this “can-do” attitude, we overcome our challenges, no matter what the odds are, and constantly seek new heights. This determination has made us who we are today – an extraordinary nation despite our lack of natural resources.

**Values in Action Programme** 

![](/images/5%20(2).png)

Our Values in Action (VIA) programme focuses on developing and showing the value of care. This is aligned with the school’s vision of having its pupils contributing to our future. The ACE framework guides the programming of our VIA activities where ACE is an acronym that represents various actions taken by the pupils depending on the context and VIA experience:

To ensure continuity of the pupils’ experiences, the VIA experiences focus on care for the environment and care for others.  The VIA experiences the pupils go through culminates in the P6 VIA experience of having the pupils initiate their own VIA project which may lie in, but not limited to, the domain of caring for the environment and the elderly.

Being buddies to younger ones in school as well as with seniors at PEACE Connect are just some ways our Stamfordians put values into action.  Stmaford students also showed their gratitude to frontline workers with their words of appreciation during National Day with our ‘Stamford Salutes Frontline Workers’.

**Cyber-Wellness Workshops** <br>
To equip our pupils more in practising safe habits online, our teachers conduct Cyber Wellness workshops for our Primary 5 and 6 pupils. The workshops aim to heighten awareness in our pupils to protect their identity online, assess how safe their online habits are and promote responsible use of online tools. A variety of fun and engaging activities are carried out to encourage open discussion and highlight their online habits such as a self-assessment checklist, role-playing, group discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of social media tools and completing an online quiz as a group.

Our pupils embark on a Cyber Quest with their classmates to learn how to navigate the virtual world safely. The P6 level also embarked on a Cyberwellness project to educate their younger peers on Cyberwelless issues.

**Education and Career Guidance** <br>
Pupils on educational pathways available to them after graduating from primary school. ECG lessons, embedded within the FTGP curriculum, are carried out at P5 and P6. A key resource pupils have is the ecareers portal (ecareers.sg) which they are first introduced to during their FTGP lesson.  P5 and P6 pupils meet with the school counsellor at least once per year and undergo education and career guidance counselling. As part of raising career awareness, guest speakers are invited to speak about their careers or activities are conducted to expose our pupils to the nature of their jobs. For example, our P1-6s learnt about the jobs of our some school and community partners through our ‘In-Conversation’ series.

Stamford Primary also explores tie-ups with institutions of higher learning to raise pupils’ awareness of the programmes and style of learning offered. We carry out differentiated activities that cater to the developmental needs of pupils at different levels. We also seek to work with parents so as to create greater awareness and interest.

**Student Leadership Development** <br>
Student Leadership at Stamford Primary School offers our pupils an opportunity to serve at different levels. In the spirit of servant leadership, a Stamfordian shows he or she can care and contribute when placed in a position of leadership. We nurture our pupils to have the ability to lead and equip them with leadership competencies aligned to our ENRICH values. Class level leadership opportunities are given to the pupils in the class. School level leadership opportunities are given to pupils who have shown aptitude in this area. The process of selection and appointment of prefects is rigorous and thorough, involving teachers, school leaders and pupils. CCA leaders are appointed by their respective CCA teachers too. Development of student leaders includes on-the-job training, mentoring by teachers and seniors and training workshops. To emphasise the importance of Student Leadership, we have a Student Leadership Day to highlight the key to being a student leader, that is, to take responsibility to serve for the good of the community and influence others to do the same.
