Stamford Primary School believes in providing and creating leadership opportunities for every student and in nurturing them to become exemplary students.  The school has put in place a leadership structure to develop the leadership competencies of our student leaders through three levels of leadership dimensions. 

### Signature Programmes

To develop their leadership skills, student leaders are introduced to the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership, a leadership development theory founded by James M. Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner. Student leaders will learn, how as leaders, they can Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge a Process, Enable Others to Act and Encourage the Heart.

The school conducts leadership trainings every term to develop the leadership qualities of our student leaders. Teachers-in-charge of various teams get them to come together to bond with their peers and, acquire the knowledge and skills that are essential for them to carry out their roles and responsibilities as a leader. They also discuss solutions to problems encountered in their course of duty.

As the top echelon of the student leadership body, Level 3 student leaders lead the charge in representing the voice of the student body. They will brainstorm and put up work improvement proposals to create a more conducive school environment.
