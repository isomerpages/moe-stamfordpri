### Our Beliefs

In line with our school’s mission and vision, we believe that appropriate and effective use of homework can contribute to the students’ holistic development. In doing so, we hope to nurture Stamfordians to be independent learners who are creative thinkers and problem solvers.

### Objectives of Homework Policy

This policy aims to:

1. ensure that parents/guardians understand clearly and are aware of what their child/ward is expected to do;
2. ensure consistency of approach throughout the school;
3. provide a structure for teachers so that a standard approach will be taken to ensure that every student is able to cope with homework;
4. use homework as a tool to help extend learning beyond the classroom; and
5. encourage students and their parents to share and enjoy the learning experiences.

### Definition of Homework

Homework refers to any learning activity that the school requires students to complete outside of curriculum time, regardless of the mode of delivery (i.e. pen- and-paper or virtually). This includes assignments and projects but not the revision of schoolwork or studying for tests and examinations.

### Objectives of Homework

The school believes that homework is necessary and may be given for one or more of the following purposes:

1. Consolidate, reinforce and deepen students' understanding of concepts, knowledge, and/or skills learnt in class;
2. Allow students to regularly practice and apply skills and concepts taught;
3. Review and check students' understanding and progress so as to provide timely feedback, intervention and support;
4. Allow teachers to review effectiveness of lesson;
5. Develop a child’s concentration skills and positive work ethics, good study habits and personal skills such as organisational and time management skills, self- evaluation and self-direction;
6. Develop confidence and self-discipline necessary for independent work habits; and
7. Provide opportunities for parents/guardians, and the school to work together as part of their continuous partnership in the child’s learning.

### Roles and Responsibilities of Stakeholders

Educators, parents/guardians and learners all play an important role in ensuring that homework serves its intended purposes.

<u><Strong>Responsibilities of the teacher</strong></u><br>
The teacher should:

* design age- and developmentally-appropriate homework (i.e. tasks should not require adult supervision or help) which encourages critical thinking and which students can complete independently
* set realistic deadline for submission of homework;
* establish clear expectations to students on the purpose of homework;
* provide clear instructions to students and an explanation of the assignment to parents when necessary;
* check homework and provide intervention and support when necessary;
* provide constructive and timely feedback on students’ learning progress to both students and parents;
* coordinate with other subject teachers of the class on the frequency and quantity of homework to be assigned; and
* assign homework regularly as far as possible

<u><Strong>Responsibilities of the student</strong></u><br>
The student should:
* understand the instructions given so that he/she is clear of what is expected and is able to work independently to complete all tasks set;
* manage time well and ensure adherence to the deadline set;
* take greater ownership and responsibility for independent learning and ensure that all homework is done to the best of his/her ability; and
* review feedback from teachers on homework submitted.

<u><strong>Responsibilities of the parent/guardian</strong></u><br>
The parent/guardian should:
* provide a conducive home environment for studying and completion of homework, and during HBL days, the learning space should have a reasonably strong Wi-fi signal or enough bandwidth for internet access.
* reinforce positive attitudes, good learning routines and study habits with the child/ward;
* reinforce the significance of structure for HBL days in ensuring that the child continues to follow established routines at home;
* supervise, ensure the child/ward completes the assigned homework and provide support for the child/ward when necessary;
* be mindful of the stresses arising from school homework and out-of-school activities, and help their children prioritise their time among these activities; and
* communicate with the teacher regularly to ensure that the child/ward is coping well with the homework assigned and to support their child’s learning and development.

### Guidelines for Time Spent on Homework

Different children might take different amount of time to complete similar assignments. It is important to ensure that all homework assigned caters to the individual needs and ability. It is the quality of the completed work that matters and not the quantity of the homework assigned.

The following tables show the allocation of time for homework for the different levels of students:

\*_As school ends at 2.50 pm, and 5 pm for students with CCA on Mondays, teachers would exercise discretion when assigning homework._

* Assignments (EL, MA, SC & MT) should be submitted on the following school day. If homework given requires more than the assigned duration for the day to complete, the date of submission can be moderated accordingly. For example, if English homework given at P1 requires about 30 minutes to be completed, an extra day can be given for the student to submit the homework.
* Assignments (PHE, Art, Music, SS, CCE) could be submitted in one week’s time.
