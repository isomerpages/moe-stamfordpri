### Our Beliefs

In line with our school’s mission and vision, we believe that appropriate and effective use of homework can contribute to the students’ holistic development. In doing so, we hope to nurture Stamfordians to be independent learners who are creative thinkers and problem solvers.

### Objectives of Homework Policy

This policy aims to:

1. ensure that parents/guardians understand clearly and are aware of what their child/ward is expected to do;
2. ensure consistency of approach throughout the school;
3. provide a structure for teachers so that a standard approach will be taken to ensure that every student is able to cope with homework;
4. use homework as a tool to help extend learning beyond the classroom; and
5. encourage students and their parents to share and enjoy the learning experiences.

### Definition of Homework

Homework refers to any learning activity that the school requires students to complete outside of curriculum time, regardless of the mode of delivery (i.e. pen- and-paper or virtually). This includes assignments and projects but not the revision of schoolwork or studying for tests and examinations.

### Objectives of Homework

The school believes that homework is necessary and may be given for one or more of the following purposes:

1. Consolidate, reinforce and deepen students' understanding of concepts, knowledge, and/or skills learnt in class;
2. Allow students to regularly practice and apply skills and concepts taught;
3. Review and check students' understanding and progress so as to provide timely feedback, intervention and support;
4. Allow teachers to review effectiveness of lesson;
5. Develop a child’s concentration skills and positive work ethics, good study habits and personal skills such as organisational and time management skills, self- evaluation and self-direction;
6. Develop confidence and self-discipline necessary for independent work habits; and
7. Provide opportunities for parents/guardians, and the school to work together as part of their continuous partnership in the child’s learning.
