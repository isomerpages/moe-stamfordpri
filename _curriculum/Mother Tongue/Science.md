At Stamford Primary School, we seek to nurture curiosity. We want each student to learn to enjoy and value science as an essential tool to help them explore their natural and physical world.  We aim to provide strong science fundamentals to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work. We encourage interest in environmental issues and agencies to take action for and advocate sustainability.

### Programmes

We align our belief in sustainability education with the national movement in the Singapore Green Plan 2030.

We design learning experiences to help students understand real-world issues and how the individual could positively contribute to sustainable development. Through curated suites of activities that lead up to commemoration events such as the annual World Water Day, Earth Day, Biodiversity Week and Clean Plate Campaign, students learn about specific issues affecting the environment and human communities. They demonstrate their learning through various means, e.g., creating posters to spread awareness, recycling their food waste into fertiliser, and growing their own produce using urban farming techniques.

We also support the development of leadership skills in our Science & Environment Ambassadors (two students from each class). Besides training our student leaders in leadership and science communication skills, we provide them with extensive opportunities to practice the skills and influence their peers to take action.
