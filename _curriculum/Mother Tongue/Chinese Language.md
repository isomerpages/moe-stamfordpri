### Programme

The curriculum is structured to enable every student to achieve as high a level as he/she can. Students who demonstrate exceptional language ability and a strong interest in the subject will be recommended to maximize their potential through the learning of Higher Chinese.

To support students who need more help in the learning of CL, we have piloted the CL Support Programme. The students in this programme will receive differentiated instructions in class to enable them to cope with the common curriculum at P3.&nbsp;We also organize the following cultural and reading activities for students annually:&nbsp;

*   Chinese New Year Celebration&nbsp;
*   Mother Tongue Language Fortnight&nbsp;
*   Story Telling Sessions

**CL Enrichment - Speech and Drama** <br>
The P2 Speech and Drama programme promotes an interest in the learning of the Mother Tongue Languages and provides students with opportunities to use the language. The students enjoyed the lessons as it helps them to gain confidence and build on their interpersonal skills.

**Using Story to Improve Literacy Learning** <br>
Using storytelling in the classroom is one way to address literacy development by improving oral language, reading comprehension and writing. Because of the interrelated nature of the processes involved in reading and writing, storytelling is an effective pedagogical strategy that can woven into instruction to increase students’ competencies in all areas.

### Chinese New Year 2022 Celebration

Monday, 31 Jan 2022, was a memorable and joyous occasion for all Stamfordians as the school celebrated its second Lunar New Year amidst the Covid-19 situation. Despite strict Safe Management Measures, Stamfordians were in high spirits preparing for the new year.

As early as a week prior to the event, videos on the story of nian (年), the legendary monster, and practices associated with Chinese New Year were shown during recesses&nbsp;to&nbsp;raise awareness of the Chinese culture and traditions in our multi-racial Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classroom decoration competition was also held where students and their Form Teachers put in their best efforts to decorate their classrooms within a week using hand-made ornaments and recyclable materials. Their excellent teamwork and creativity paid off when our school leaders visited every class and revealed the results for the Best Decorated Class award for each level during the concert.

Similar to last year, this year's celebration leveraged on technology to bring the concert virtually to the classes. The celebration started with the tradition Bai Nian&nbsp;(拜年),&nbsp;prefect representatives presented the mandarin oranges and sent their New Year greetings to the school leaders in exchange for the red packets&nbsp;(红包）. This was followed by a pre-recorded video from our PSG, sharing on how they celebrate Chinese New Year in their respective countries. The learning extended to&nbsp;the next segment, the&nbsp;classroom activities, where students deepened their understanding about the Chinese&nbsp;New Year&nbsp;custom, and had a customized hands-on experience making different handicrafts. The Primary&nbsp;2 and Primary 3 students were engaged in making the Tiger Zodiac Mask, the&nbsp;Primary&nbsp;4 and Primary 5&nbsp;students created their own Chinese lanterns, whilst the&nbsp;Primary&nbsp;6&nbsp;students made the paper dragon puppet and wrote their new year wishes on them.&nbsp;

Stamfordians were treated to an array of dance and music performed by our talented students from the SHINE and Dance CCA groups. Our twinning school, Shaanxi Sheng Xi’an Shi Fan Fu Shu Xiao Xue (&nbsp;**陕西省西安师范附属小学**&nbsp;)&nbsp;&nbsp;also joined us in celebration by sharing a pre-recorded video on their local Chinese New Year traditional practices such as paper-cutting&nbsp;(剪纸)&nbsp;and new year greetings from their students.

The concert ended on a high note with a Kahoot quiz. Students were thrilled by the live quiz on the legend of the 12 Chinese Zodiac and the Chinese New Year customs. The class in each level with the most number of correct answer won a prize!&nbsp;

As the school ushered in the Year of the Tiger, we would like to wish everyone good health&nbsp;(身体健康&nbsp;），good progress in learning&nbsp;（学业进步）and a Happy New Year (新年快乐)!
