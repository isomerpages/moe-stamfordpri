### Goals

The department believes in nurturing our pupils into effective communicators of the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) so as to empower our pupils to become useful citizens of the 21st century. The curriculum for the MTL has 2 main goals: 

* To equip our pupils with the essential language skills and to mould them into active learners and proficient users 
* To develop in our pupils an awareness of their cultural identity and to cultivate an appreciation of their rich cultural root.
