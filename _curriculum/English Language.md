### Programme  

**Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR)** <bR>
STELLAR, aligned to the 2010 EL Syllabus by the Ministry of Education, provides a framework for the teaching and learning of the English Language. It aims to strengthen both language and reading skills, as well as promote a positive attitude towards reading in the foundation years through the use of well-established, learner-centred and developmentally appropriate pedagogical approaches using authentic children's literature.

**Learning Support Programme** <br>
The Learning Support Programme (LSP) is an early intervention programme aimed at providing additional support to students who enter Primary 1 with weak English language and literacy skills. Students are identified for the LSP through a systematic screening process. They attend special parallel EL lessons with trained personnel to engage them in activities to help them attain the level of language skills as their peers. Students are discharged from LSP when they meet both of the following criteria: A pass in the school's English Semestral Assessment, Attainment of age-appropriate reading age.  

**Extensive Reading Programme** <br>
The Extensive Reading Programme, Read Every Day (RED), aims to ignite the passion for reading in every Stamfordian. Class reading aloud sessions are conducted regularly to encourage the students to read more, widely and together. The R.E.D programme was fully implemented in 2021.
