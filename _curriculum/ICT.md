### Goals

In this digital-age society, we believe that ICT skills are crucial for every Stamfordian as they grow to make use of ICT to help them learn and perform tasks. Besides the acquisition of ICT skills, we also believe that nurturing our pupils to be discerning and responsible ICT users is just as important.  

### Programme

ICT is used as a leverage in teaching and learning, for teachers to tap on in achieving a holistic education in a vibrant learning environment for the students. The ICT Programme looks into providing opportunities for all students to acquire the relevant digital literacy skills, preparing them for the 21st Century.

 We plan a comprehensive ICT programme for students for all levels. We infuse the use of New Media Literacies into subject areas to allow our students to curate, create and connect in the digital networked environment where they are familiar.

 Students learn a spectrum of skills, from the basics of touch-typing to the use of data collection and communication tools.  Our students also get to collaborate and learn independently using Google Classroom.

 Teachers also learn to design engaging SLS lessons based using the SLS pedagogical scaffolding as a guide.  Lessons planning include the consideration to include Active learning Processes and the use of Learning Design Map. Teachers also get to strengthen their competencies in e-Pedagogy as part of the development under Skillsfuture for Educatiors.

 Stamfordians exposure to technology does not limit only to classroom learning. They also get to learn technological skills through the Maker Education programme. Lower Primary students will learn the use of technology through fun and play activities. Upper Primary students will enhance their technological competencies through skills acquisition through coding, digital maker and robotics activities. Students are also enriched with participation for Code for Fun and Digital Bootcamp.

 While encouraging our students to be technologically savvy, we also recognise the importance of educating our students to be discerning and responsible ICT users. Our Cyber Wellness Programme educates students on potential risks and possible dangers that can take place in the cyber world and teaches them the skills to deal with the risks and to protect themselves. Students get to learn sound values through assembly programmes like drama, talks and level focused interaction sharing.
